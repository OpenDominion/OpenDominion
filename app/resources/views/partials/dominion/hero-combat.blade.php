Each turn you can choose from one of the five following actions:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>Attack: deals damage equal to your attack minus the opponent's defense</li>
    <li>Defend: doubles your defense if attacked this turn</li>
    <li>Focus: increases your attack value for your next attack action</li>
    <li>Counter: if attacked this turn, performs a counter attack</li>
    <li>Recover: heals damage, but reduces your defense by 5 this turn</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, each combatant has a chance to evade incoming attacks, reducing the damage by half.</p>
<p>Attack and Defend can be used an unlimited number of times, while each of the other actions can only be used every other turn.</p>
<p>When you run out of match time, your hero will take actions automatically using the selected strategy.</p>
<p>Heroes gain an additional 5 health with every level up and are be granted combat bonuses with each upgrade they unlock.</p>
