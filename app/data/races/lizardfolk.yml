description: >-
  <p>The Lizardfolk took everyone by surprise when they slithered out of the oceans in great numbers less than a century ago, attacking and pillaging coastal settlements before gradually pushing further inland. Their origins are pure speculation, ranging from Human scientific experimentation to Merfolk slave liberation.</p>
  <p>With chameleonic warriors that melt into the shadows and blend in perfectly with their environments, by the time you realize the Lizardfolk are coming... it's already too late.</p>
