description: >-
  <p>With ashen skin and ink-black eyes, Dark Elves are the cave-dwelling distant cousins of the majestic Wood Elves. Corrupted long ago by whispered promises of power from demonic entities, Dark Elves are a cruel species who thrive on torment and suffering.</p>
  <p>Dark Elves have black magic coursing through their veins. Capable of calling down a rain of fire and lightning upon their enemies, they are a terrifying force to reckon with. Their most gifted Swordsmen, tempered through combat, can ascend to become revered Spellblades; masters of both sword and sorcery.</p>
