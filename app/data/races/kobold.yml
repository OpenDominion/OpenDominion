name: Kobold
alignment: good
description: >-
  <p>Aggressive, beast-like and intensely xenophobic, Kobolds are almost universally reviled wherever they trespass. Kobolds are only interested in two things: eating, and... well let's just say they think "monogamy" is a dirty word.</p>
  <p>As a result, Kobolds are usually treated with extreme hostility due to their uncontrollable population growth. If not discovered and dealt with early, a Kobold nest can quickly become a swarm and overwhelm even a well-fortified dominion with sheer numbers alone.</p>
