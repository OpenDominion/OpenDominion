description: >-
  <p>The Undead are a collection of those who have defied death - skeleton puppets, flesh-obsessed ghouls, bloodthirsty vampires and their hideous progeny. This rag-tag alliance all share one thing in common: a hatred of life. They exist to end it, or drag it kicking and screaming into the shadow of undeath.</p>
  <p>Extremely hard to kill, the Undead are constantly bolstering their ranks with more corpses. The Undead tend to live in fetid swamps, where the cloying humid air acts a natural preservative, protecting the skin from rot. Vampires are a vain bunch.</p>
