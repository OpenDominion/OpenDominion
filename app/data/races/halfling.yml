alignment: good
description: >-
  <p>Halflings are strange little creatures, short and slight, caught somewhere between a human child and an elf in appearance, with oversized hands and long, dexterous fingers. They are almost completely nocturnal, with pale white skin and wet black eyes that shine a sickly green in the dark.</p>
  <p>Halfling physiology makes them natural spies and thieves. Halflings can be very dangerous - particularly in groups, flying into a violent frenzy when cornered.</p>
