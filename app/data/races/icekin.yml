description: >-
  <p>Slow, lumbering elementals of frost and stone, Icekin emerged from the snow-capped mountains at the same time Human pyromancy experiments gave birth to the Firewalkers.</p>
  <p>The creeping cold of the Icekin expands ever outwards, insistent, transforming the lands around them with white permafrost and hijacking the weather with never-ending blizzards. Icekin can become an immense military threat once they become well fortified.</p>
