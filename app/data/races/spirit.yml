description: >-
  <p>Trapped between the realm of the living and what lies beyond, Spirits are a melancholic collection of lost souls, drifting the wetlands, forever restless.</p>
  <p>Lately, Spirit incursions into the territories of the living have become more frequent, though nobody knows why. With soul-rending wails, Spirits can strike fear in the hearts of those unprepared to face such horrors, sending many fleeing in terror before the battle even begins.</p>
