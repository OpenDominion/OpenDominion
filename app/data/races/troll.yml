description: >-
  <p>Hard to kill, and even harder to look at without screaming, Trolls are the hideously ugly but tremendously powerful genetic dead end of an ancient elven race.</p>
  <p>Trolls are notoriously bloodthirsty. What they lack in subtlety they more than make up for in gratuitous violence. It is not uncommon to see fully-armoured soldiers being punted up sixty feet into the air during Troll invasions. <em>[Urg smash!]</em></p>
