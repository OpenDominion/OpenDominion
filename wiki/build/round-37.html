<p>This was the first round to be won by <a href="exploring.html" title="Exploring">exploring</a>. The round is notorious for having an early, <a href="runaway.html" title="Runaway">runaway</a> <a href="orc.html" title="Orc">Orc</a>, against which an <a href="alliance.html" title="Alliance">alliance</a> was formed. <a href="ross-wigdor.html" title="Ross Wigdor">Ross</a> deleted the <a href="cheating.html" title="Cheating">cheaters</a>, which in turn gave DerangedBabysitsMe.mpeg and TetreExploreScript.css a great lead and they were never caught up with. This is still a controversial issue.
</p><p>After this round, Ross implemented the <a href="rulesets.html#Gameplay" title="Rulesets">explore bump</a>, which is a certain landsize where the cost of exploration goes up. This was to <a href="nerf.html" title="Nerf">nerf</a> exploring in general.
</p>
<a name="Roundwin_Story" id="Roundwin_Story"></a><h1> <span class="mw-headline"> Roundwin Story </span></h1>
<p>There's no real point in putting up two posts with identical stories, so we just decided to write our story together. So consider this post Kari’s too, she wrote half of it.&nbsp;:)
</p><p>We were talking strats before the round started. We thought if there was a way an explorer could win, it was by blackopping the hell out of anyone who ran away. Kari wasn't supposed to play this round, but after we talked she insisted it would work and invited herself into the currently non-existent pack.&nbsp;;) We didn't think we'd get a pack of 6 active explorers. Don't ask how we did get 6 people crazy enough to do it, but we managed.&nbsp;:)
</p><p>Chen and Peter (Glory) were with us last round (36) and agreed to pack again. We initially asked Zedijar and Robbie to pack with us. Zed wasn't replying, Robbie declined and said he wanted to attack. Scratch already had an Adoption thread up on the boards, but we emailed asking him if he's found anyone yet, anyway. We asked Spoox over irc, and he agreed.
</p><p>Our realm is certainly worth mentioning. We landed with Raju and bear, who both randomed. The rest of the realm was attacking and fairly active. After sending them messages we were able to help most of them out with strats, allowing them to grow faster, of course. They were of great help with the Great Market, which we got around week 3 (I think).They took it in 3 waves the first time and took it back twice within 12 hours when we lost it late-round.&nbsp;:) Thanks a lot to everyone who participated.
</p><p>We simmed ourselves a 690 acre Nox with 200 schools and 6.5k mainly elite DP. That sim cost us our sleep all protection, but it also put us way ahead of any other techer. We never dropped out of top-50 while teching, we finished our 7 techs day 14 and grew into top-10 in no time. #50 was doing most of the blackopping for us so we decided to stay low profile. The first runaway was Emesel as a DE, which kinda sucked since he wasnt sinkable or FBable. Lucky for us the merfolk took him down. A bit later we moved our peace to Robbie. BAD timing, we didn’t expect him to run yet. He made his run while we couldn’t cancel our peace, so no war was possible. Also, he had the Armada which made it hard to do anything.
We were quite obviously the only 2 in the game who could keep up with his insane OP pumps. After all the people (who for some didn’t realize how much he could pump) were knocked down, Robbie was stuck without targets.
At that point we started to try and get Robbie out of guard so we could blackop him with the pack. We were going to outgrow him easily if he stayed in the guard so he had to leave at some point. Dennis will post more about the whole Robbie thing since he didn’t post his part yet.
After Robbie went down basically all the big attackers either got hit or Rossinated. Which is why Burnt was able to get this big-- he could simply suicide with chams up to the 4:3 rule because there was noone left to punish him for doing so.
We declared war on Burnt asap and FB-ed him down to really low pessies, our pack did a great job there. Burnt was stupid enough to declare mutual allowing us to gain some prestige too =) But his suicidal OP was enough to keep making hits anyway, with only explorers in his range 50k DP wouldve been enough for him if the 4:3 rule didnt exist.
At the end it was kinda close. We would’ve outgrown him if he didn’t make a hit. He had to leave EG to hit and there might have been some potential suiciders waiting for him there with his low DP (though I’m not sure about that). If he made a BF he would’ve won it, otherwise he would’ve been some acres short. Not like all of that mattered in the end since he deleted, and we’re not sure what the real story there is.
</p><p>Thanks so much again to Scratch, Chen, Spoox and Peter for being great packies and to our realmies Gas, Raju, Bear, Aggieland, Cyka, Yingas (Pwnies), Old Camelot, Timbuktu, Disney and Me Eat Trees for all the help (we wouldn't be this big without you guys) and keeping the council fun and active all round.

<p>Freedom
</p><p>Last night, i was the biggest and strongest dominion by far. (Libertas, realm #43) If you asked anyone that day he would agree that this would be my third victory of dominion.
</p><p>Because there were no targets inside my Elite Guard that i could outtrain, i was forced to leave its protective power and seek for targets in the Royal Guard. My realmies had been able to check out the most obvious threats and i decided that top sendable offense in my range was 300k. I sent out, hit an explorer, left 315k defense and had 15k incoming. Now, when i woke up, i saw my dominion at 4k acres, which was 2900 less acres than i left it behind with. Huge news, many things in our Town Crier. Apparently i underestimated things. While checking what happened, i noticed i got hit once more, had a lot less defense and 5 minutes later i was put back to the login screen after a click. I realised that i had lost 'too many' acres and was scripted by the anti-'farm' script. My account gone, vanished, erased from history. There won't even be a notice of my dominion in the lifetime rankings. My realmies are left baffled with my sudden absence and a red Town Crier. I had no way to retalliate, i did not even have access to all the information that could identify lame behaviour of my competitive colleagues in the game. Apparently, only my landsize was reason enough to attract a suicide and two razes which had an impact on my defense large enough to bring it down to a level on which multiple dominions were capable of hitting me. As it turns out, realm #59 has been misbehaving, in the sense that they employed a teamed effort to get me scripted. It envolves Bleach, a dark elf in realm #59 and realm #16 that did the hitting. Surely raze hitting is a frowned upon strategy, one that #59 has employed a few times this round. However, raze hitting for a different realm to invade and get someone scripted should be cause of intervention of a game administrator. For if that is allowed who needs Kamikazegames' Liege Lord Alliance game?
</p><p>But even without the razes (three in total), i suppose my dominion would have suffered a similar fate. It's all in the game, and i knew what i was doing. I underestimated the forces, mods and suicide capabilities of a dominion that lied outside of my range.
</p><p>Well, i guess i am finally free. Even now i'm thinking hourchange! as this game does require extreme activity. When i go to bed, i have to cast fools gold, but then i have to set my alarm because if i wake up a minute too late, half of my income will be gone from plat theft. And then during the day, one has to be there at least every few hours for the same reason.
</p><p>Like many rounds, I started this one with a pack comprising of people i like chatting with - i grew tired of packing people solely for their dominion skills a long time ago. I valued the ability to talk to one another as human beings above being able to talk about dominion and plat/hr. Before the round, i got excited about a simple strategy that i 'discovered' on my strategy sheet. An orc with no bonebreakers, all savages for offense. Smithies, high barracks, and only voodoo magi as defense. In my eyes, the strategy was overpowered, even though Ross nerfed the Orc prestige bonus from 200% a while ago to 125% for this round. I got a packy excited about this, and the others took Lizardfolk en Dark Elf, which was nice for getting information on otherwise hard to check dominions. It was all routine for me, and i got frustrated a bit at times at some packies that they couldnt follow me or were less active. I was an ass at times really. Perhaps it was wrong to start playing. Sure, playing an overpowered strat and doing well is nice, but the game has cost me so much time and energy that could have been spent far better in people around me. Even so, the first few weeks were great. I enjoyed getting to the top together with my realmies and see my strat work out nicely.
</p><p>For some reason many people judge others by their achieved landsizes in the past, as if the voice of one without much experience with the game is worth less. Reminds me of the l33t badminton people at the university that seem to think they have more right to play than others. This type of thinking dominated on the irc as it was back in the early rounds. "n00bs" were abused and scared away, people were mostly angry and talking crap all the time. Im glad that ever since the Dutch took over and started a new irc channel, new people were welcome and a different kind of ethical standard was held high. People have started the huggling sprees and perhaps respect eachother more.
</p><p>I want to thank my packies - Scorpio, ActiveWaste, Lieke, Aisha and Jigsie - for their company, many great pieces of teamwork like getting the Imperial Armada (thanks Richie), scouting around for top ops (thanks Lori), helping eachother out when in need (thanks for all the cses Andreea), laughing together in the council and making this round interesting. Thanks Lieke and Jill for putting up with me and getting my head out of my ass.&nbsp;:)
</p><p>For the Queen of Ice,
</p><p>Robbie

<p>Original Post- Posted at: 8/11/2006 4:20:44 PM
</p><p>I had ops on 59 and knew he had 300k and as everydom goes for the win im pretty sure he would tap Libertas, leaving 250k DP, which is less than me on 100 lands over.
</p><p>Then, BR would prolly still have more lands than I so Lizardfolkk in 63 would grab him.
After all this, arapau would grab 59 gobbo since 59 had more lands than I on less DP.
And everything was good since other good OP was out, before BR hitted.
</p><p>Things went differently and BR got killed by my packmate ( who saw I was getting on top ) if BR was scripted, since BR woulda been able to retaill me.
</p><p>At that moment best things I could imagine were on until I see my lands got scripted, I still dont get it but anyways I was going on TOP since my trolls decided for a nowhere reason to put 59 gobbo ( my biggest threat ) down.
So thats about my story, after this i had to keep good dp home making little hits just to fly away since I was able to 4:3
</p><p>Then 29, who had good dp decided to try to slow me down waring us.
They did slow me down but they eat some fireballs too and lightning bolts by my king who had so many wizards/towers and Vjs who went crazy LB'in them since they werent in guard.
</p><p>Then, I made some more hit to try to run outta range of 29's DEs. After all this I hitted a guy in 50 ( Vovin ) and omg, my troll double tapped him so they came on IRC and talked iwth me, WE GONNA WAR U, WE GONNA WAR U.
So there it goes, they wared us and killed about 10k peasies, they were 2 sylvans FB'in me, so I said ok its enough lets kill one of them. I just pumped OP and smacked one of them down.
</p><p>THEN came day 49 when I was going to hit someone without any spell on ( realm 14 summer ) when I saw my 4:3 wasnt working cause of the rule.
</p><p>So I said huh, I have enough DP to send this OP so I calced back mods and all stuff and saw all GTs were down.
OH there TreM cameback in his account 30 days after giving up.
Anyways I know I was going over 9.5 so I Think I made it.
The reason why I deleted is just because when U see a win coming and its there onn the invade button and u fail cause of some a*$holes, its... VERY frustrating.
</p><p>Worst thing of all is that it was on trem's lifetime so I dont get why he destroyed his own GT on the win.
I do think its maybe VJS who did it but I dont know, trem tells me he didnt give the psw.
Anyways, Dennis won this being a cheater OPS sharing, but I explained how I saw that, I did hesitate if I shoudl take them but I decided not to and wait to play the game fairly.
</p><p>Anyways, one more hit I forgot is Fingal's hit I made, he went on IRC asking me to team up a bit and play my game so he would let me live, I said ok.
</p><p>NO WAY, dont trust anybody there, I calced his dp, his 4:3 and saw it was impossible for him to retail me after I hit him so I just played it fair there again.
</p><p>Well I dedicate this round to MrIffy, which is one of the greatest player dominion could see. He kept on giving me advices, I kept on YELLING MRIFFFFFFYYYYY on msn to ask him some too and put it to the end, thx Iffy, hope I can team up with tha master someday.
Thanks to IC, which is always there to give me some advices too.
</p><p>I wanna personnaly thank all my packies for what they did for me too, helping with OPS and luck givin me the win over the gobbo.
</p><p>I really enjoyed this round but dont get too addictive guys, make it once for all and after get a life.. dom gives nothing heh.
Hope to see all of u again on dominion in the next few rounds, its a pleasure to play... except for the HUGE WASTE of time.

<a name="J.27s_goodbye" id="J.27s_goodbye"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> J's goodbye </span></h2>
<p>I was Bitemarks and Bloodstains (# 63).I think I'll quit for now. Thanks to my packies this round eventhough only morph is the only guy left. I know I messed up with the NAP with 57.
</p><p>Regarding robbie's account, libertas. Yeah it was all coordinated. The noxes in 29 gave out full info on your dom out so people have an idea on what op to pump to break you while you were still in elite guard. They even helped organized the thing. Everyone was lined up to hit Libertas. It's easy to figure out that the first guys who hit him could easily break each other.
</p><p>There was an agreement to hit libertas alone. First guy who hardly could've broken libertas was Burnt, I just want to PLAY! (# 64). I was supposed to be the second guy to hit but I lacked op, the gobbo Turbelence, Cowb0y BeB0P (# 59) lacked like 3k op iirc which he had the next hour but he forgot peace and bounced. After I was supposed to hit but Arapau, Cannabis (# 16) jumped the gun but bounced because he forgot crusade. Then i did my hit leaving like 1.5k+ lizardmen home. Then came 16 gnome, one of 57's multi. 59 de razed robbie too. Probably because their big gobbo bounced and wasnt gonna gain anything. VJS from 64 scripted robbie because robbie was gonna obiously gonna nail Burnt I just want to PLAY! (# 64) back.
</p><p>57 is played by only 3 guys, donman, zedijar and doink, crosslogging. And donman is playing gnome in 16 that hit robbie too. Traex knows this fact too. Sorry Ed for getting you nailed because I only talked to donman and he didnt inform zedijar that the orc account in 57 was supposed to be nap'ed with out whole realm.
With that congrats robbie on the win, you deserved it.... See you guys
